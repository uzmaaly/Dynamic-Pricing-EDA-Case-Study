ðŸ‘¾ **Data Enthusiast | Future AI Overlord**

ðŸ¤“ Currently training to talk to machines in Python, accidentally making them too smart.

ðŸ”® On a quest to make sense of the chaos (aka data) and maybe, just maybe, teach robots to appreciate good humor.

ðŸ“Š Special skills include wrangling wild datasets and occasionally breaking Jupyter notebooks (itâ€™s a feature, not a bug).

ðŸŒŸ Aspiring expert in Generative AI, NLP, and MLâ€”but still waiting for my algorithms to stop plotting world domination.
