# Dynamic-Pricing-EDA-Case-Study
In this case study, I conducted an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset related to dynamic pricing in a ride-sharing service. The primary goal was to identify key factors that influence the historical cost of rides. Through comprehensive analysis, I explored various features such as Vehicle_Type and Expected_Ride_Duration to understand their impact on pricing. The insights gained from this analysis will serve as the foundation for further predictive modeling, aiming to optimize pricing strategies and improve the accuracy of cost predictions. This project demonstrates my ability to extract meaningful insights from data, laying the groundwork for data-driven decision-making in dynamic pricing models.
